# Friendsr

Friendsr is an app where users can look up some of my favorite rappers, including signature lines. It's also possible to give them a rating. For the ProfileActivity page I used a contraint layout to make it look way better.


## Usage

Scroll through the rappers, select the one you want to check out and give them a rating on their profilepage.
